# Product Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview

This project aims to classify products into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset comprises product images collected from the Slash application, covering a wide range of categories. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and preprocessing steps are applied to prepare the images for model training.

## Objectives

- Investigate the effectiveness of various CNN architectures for product classification.
- Implement and evaluate multiple CNN models on the test dataset.
- Apply techniques such as data augmentation, regularization, and early stopping to improve model performance.

## Approach

- **Data Preparation**: The dataset is preprocessed, and images are prepared for model training.
- **Model Development**: Several CNN architectures are implemented to classify products.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set to assess their performance.
- **Optimization**: Techniques such as data augmentation, regularization, and early stopping are applied to enhance model accuracy and prevent overfitting.

## Next Steps

- Further fine-tuning of models for better performance.
- Exploration of additional techniques to improve classification accuracy.
- Deployment of the optimized model for practical use.

## Conclusion

Through this project, the goal is to build a robust product classification system using deep learning techniques, with the potential for real-world applications in various industries.
